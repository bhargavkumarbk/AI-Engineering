{"guideline_source":"NHLBI Asthma Guidelines","recommendation_summary":"For children with persistent asthma, clinicians should follow a stepwise approach to therapy. This involves escalating treatment as needed or deescalating once asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months. For children ages 5-11, SMART with low- or medium-dose ICS therapy is preferred over same-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA as part of Step 3 and Step 4 therapy. Clinicians should inform caregivers about the benefits of combination ICS-formoterol used daily and as needed, which include reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits and in the use of systemic corticosteroids.","reference_section":"Stepwise Approach for Management of Asthma in Individuals Ages 5–11 Years"}
{"guideline_source":"J Am Acad Dermatol","recommendation_summary":"For the management of atopic dermatitis, strong recommendations are made for the use of dupilumab, tralokinumab, abrocitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib. Conditional recommendations are in favor of using phototherapy, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. Systemic corticosteroids are generally not recommended unless no other options are available or as a bridge to other long-term therapies.","reference_section":"J Am Acad Dermatol 2024;90:e43-56."}
