Below is a README for your "Auto Insurance Claim Processor" source code, inspired by the example you provided. Iâ€™ve tailored it to reflect your projectâ€™s specificsâ€”using Streamlit, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, and LlamaCloud for an AI-driven auto insurance claim processing app. It includes installation steps, setup instructions, a demo placeholder (since you didnâ€™t provide one), and a contribution section, all formatted in a clean, professional style.

# Auto Insurance Claim Processor

This project builds an AI-powered app to process auto insurance claims efficiently. It allows users to upload a claim in JSON format, retrieves relevant policy and declaration documents, and provides a decision (approved/denied) with payout recommendations.

We use:
- **Streamlit** to create an intuitive UI.
- **LlamaIndex** to orchestrate the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow.
- **OpenAI** for language model processing (e.g., GPT-4o or GPT-4).
- **LlamaCloud** for vector-based retrieval of policy and declaration documents.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or later.
- A working internet connection for API calls.

### Detailed Setup

#### **Setup OpenAI**
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. Set it in your environment or directly in the app via the sidebar:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
   ```
   Alternatively, enter it in the "OpenAI API Key" field in the appâ€™s sidebar.

#### **Setup LlamaCloud**
1. Get an API key from [LlamaCloud](https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/) (sign up and generate a key).
2. Set it in your environment or via the sidebar:
   ```bash
   export LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=<YOUR_LLAMACLOUD_API_KEY>
   ```
   Alternatively, enter it in the "LlamaCloud API Key" field in the appâ€™s sidebar.
3. Ensure your LlamaCloud account has two indices:
   - `auto-insurance-claims` (for policy documents).
   - `auto-insurance-declarations` (for per-user declarations).
   - Update these names in the sidebar if different.

#### **Install Dependencies**
If you donâ€™t have a `requirements.txt` yet, install the required packages manually:
```bash
pip install streamlit llama-index-core llama-index-llms-openai llama-index-indices-managed-llama-cloud
```

#### **Run the App**
Launch the app with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
- The app will open in your browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`).
- Upload a claim JSON file, configure settings in the sidebar, and click "Process Claim" to see results.

### Example Claim JSON
Hereâ€™s a sample claim JSON to test the app:
```json
{
    "claim_number": "CLAIM-12345",
    "policy_number": "POLICY-ABC123",
    "claimant_name": "John Smith",
    "date_of_loss": "2023-05-15",
    "loss_description": "Rear-ended at stoplight by another vehicle",
    "estimated_repair_cost": 4500.00,
    "vehicle_details": "2020 Toyota Camry"
}
```
Save this as `sample_claim.json` and upload it via the app.
