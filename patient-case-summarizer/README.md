# Patient Case Summarizer

The Patient Case Summary Generator is a Streamlit app that lets healthcare professionals upload patient JSON data to create concise AI-generated summaries. It uses medical guidelines to detail conditions, encounters, and recommendations.

We use:
- LLamaCloudIndex for medical guideline retrieval
- OpenAI for processing patient data and generating case summary
- Streamlit to build the UI.

A demo is shown here:
