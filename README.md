# **Automated Medical Case Summary Generation**  

## **Overview**  
This project automates the generation of structured **medical case summaries** by analyzing patient clinical data and retrieving **guideline-based recommendations**. The system extracts patient information from a JSON file, processes medical conditions and encounters using an **LLM (GPT-4o)**, and retrieves relevant **medical guidelines** through a vector search. The final output is a structured **case summary** in JSON or human-readable format, enabling clinicians to make data-driven decisions efficiently.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Patient Data Extraction:** Reads patient details, including conditions, encounters, and medications, from a JSON file.  
- **Intelligent Grouping:** Uses an LLM to organize related medical encounters and prescriptions.  
- **Guideline Retrieval:** Employs a vector search-based retriever to find relevant, evidence-based medical guidelines.  
- **Automated Case Summary Generation:** Generates concise, structured treatment recommendations using the LLM.  
- **Structured Output:** Provides JSON-formatted or human-readable reports for easy clinical review.  
- **Logging and Debugging:** Tracks workflow progress for transparency and troubleshooting.  

## **Installation**  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkithaSuma/ai-engineering-hub
   cd AnkithaSuma-medical-case-summary
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

## **Usage**  

1. **Run the Script**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook patient_case_summary.ipynb
   ```  
   If using a Jupyter Notebook, open and execute `patient_case_summary.ipynb`.  

2. **Provide Input Data**  
   - Place your patient JSON file in the appropriate directory.  
   - Ensure the JSON file follows the correct format (an example is provided in `sample_data/`).  

3. **Review the Output**  
   - The generated case summary will be saved in JSON format.  
   - If a human-readable report is required, use the provided formatting script.
